# Default Theme

SolidBase includes a default theme that provides a clean, minimal design out of the box. It includes components for layout, navigation, and other common UI elements.

You can use the default theme as-is, or customize it to fit your needs. For more information on customizing the default theme, refer to the [Extending Themes](/guide/customization#extending-the-default-theme) guide.
