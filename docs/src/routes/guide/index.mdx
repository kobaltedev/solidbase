## Key features

### Built-in Markdown

Out of the box support for Markdown and MDX with almost all extensions you'd ever want. All the extension documentation and examples are available on our [Markdown Extensions](./md-extentions) page.

### Customizable

All SolidBase components are overridable and can transform your website into any look or structure.
Checkout our [Customization](./extending-themes#extending-the-default-theme) and [Theming](./custom-themes) documentation.

### Performant

Instant first load by prerendering each page during build, next navigation will be upgraded to client side and smoothly transition pages.
