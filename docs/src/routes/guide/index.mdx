# Introduction

SolidBase provides fully featured, fully customisable [Static Site Generation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Static_site_generator) for [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start).
It focuses on [Markdown](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Markdown) ([MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)), making it ideal for writing documentation.

You can [add SolidBase to an existing SolidStart project](/add-to-existing) or start a new project with our [quickstart guide](/quickstart).

## Key features

### Built-in Markdown

Out of the box support for Markdown and MDX with almost all extensions you'd ever want. All the extension documentation and examples are available on our [Markdown Extensions](./md-extensions) page.

### Customizable

All the SolidBase components can be overridden to transform your website into your own unique design. To see how, visit the [Extending Themes](/extending-themes) documentation.

### Performant

Instant first load by prerendering each page during build, next navigation will be upgraded to client side and smoothly transition pages.
