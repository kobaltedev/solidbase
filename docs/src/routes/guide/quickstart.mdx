## 1. Create a New Project

```package-create
solid@latest -s -t with-solidbase
```

This automatically creates a project using the [with-solidbase](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples/with-solidbase) template.

:::tip[Existing Project?]
[Add SolidBase to an existing project](../add-to-existing).
:::

## Done!

Your project is now setup with the default SolidBase theme!
You can now create Markdown routes in your project that take advantage of SolidBase's [Markdown Extensions](../markdown),
and customise your project's appearance by [customising the default theme](../extending-themes#extending-the-default-theme) or [creating a new theme](../custom-themes).
