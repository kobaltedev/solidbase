# Adding to Existing Project

SolidBase wraps your SolidStart config rather than wrapping Start itself,
so you can add SolidBase to most existing Start projects or create a new one.


## 1. Create a New Project

Follow Start's [getting started guide](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/getting-started)
to create a new project.
We'd recommend using the `basic` preset as it includes `@solidjs/router`,
and recommend against the `with-mdx` preset as SolidBase will provide MDX spport for you.

## 2. Add SolidBase to Your Project

Install `@kobalte/solidbase`:

```package-install
@kobalte/solidbase
```

In your project's `app.config`, wrap the config being passed to `defineConfig` with `withSolidBase`.
This will configure SolidBase with the default theme.

```ts
<!-- app.config.ts -->
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";
import { withSolidBase } from "@kobalte/solidbase/config";

export default defineConfig(withSolidBase(/* your SolidStart config */));
```

## 3. Wrap Your App in `SolidBaseRoot`

Add the `SolidBaseRoot` component to the `root` of your project's `Router`.

```tsx
<!-- app.tsx -->
import { SolidBaseRoot } from "@kobalte/solidbase/client";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<Router root={SolidBaseRoot}>
			<FileRoutes />
		</Router>
	);
}
```

If your router already has a `root` component, you can wrap it with `SolidBaseRoot`.

```tsx
<Router
  root={(props) => {
    return <SolidBaseRoot>{props.children}</SolidBaseRoot>;
  }}
>
  <FileRoutes />
</Router>
```

## 4. Add HTML Attributes for SSR

To provide the `lang` and `data-theme` attributes to the `html` element during SSR,
spread `getHtmlProps()` onto it in `entry-server`:

```tsx title=entry-server.tsx
// @refresh reload
import { StartServer, createHandler } from "@solidjs/start/server";
import { getHtmlProps } from "@kobalte/solidbase/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer
		document={({ assets, children, scripts }) => (
			<html {...getHtmlProps()}>
				...
			</html>
		)}
	/>
));
```

:::note
SolidBase prerenders your pages by default,
so `data-theme` will probably be incorrect in the initial HTML.
To account for this,
a small script will automatically be injected to correct the theme before the page is rendered.
:::

## Done

Your project is now setup with the default SolidBase theme!
You can now create Markdown routes in your project that take advantage of SolidBase's [Markdown Extensions](../markdown),
and customise your project's appearance by [customising the default theme](../extending-themes#extending-the-default-theme) or [creating a new theme](../custom-themes).
