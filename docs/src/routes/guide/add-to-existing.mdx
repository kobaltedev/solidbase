# {frontmatter.title}

SolidBase can be added to an existing SolidStart project in a few simple steps.


## 1. Install `@kobalte/solidbase`

To install SolidBase, run the following command in your project's root directory:

```package-install
@kobalte/solidbase
```

## 2. Update `app.config`

Since SolidBase is built on top of SolidStart, you'll need to update your `app.config` to include SolidBase's configuration. To do this, wrap the existing configuration with `withSolidBase`:

```ts title=app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";
import { withSolidBase } from "@kobalte/solidbase/config";

export default defineConfig(withSolidBase(/* your SolidStart config */));
```

## 3. Wrap Your App in `SolidBaseRoot`

Once SolidBase is installed and configured, you'll need to wrap your application in the `SolidBaseRoot` component to provide the necessary context for SolidBase to function correctly.

In your `app.tsx`, import `SolidBaseRoot` from `@kobalte/solidbase/client` and wrap it around `Router`:

```tsx {7} title="app.tsx"
import { SolidBaseRoot } from "@kobalte/solidbase/client";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<Router root={SolidBaseRoot}>
			<FileRoutes />
		</Router>
	);
}
```

If your router already has a `root` component, you can wrap it with `SolidBaseRoot`:

```tsx {3}
<Router
  root={(props) => {
    return <SolidBaseRoot>{props.children}</SolidBaseRoot>;
  }}
>
  <FileRoutes />
</Router>
```

## 4. Add HTML Attributes for SSR

To provide the `lang` and `data-theme` attributes to the `html` element during SSR,
spread `getHtmlProps()` onto it in `entry-server`:

```tsx {8} title=entry-server.tsx
// @refresh reload
import { StartServer, createHandler } from "@solidjs/start/server";
import { getHtmlProps } from "@kobalte/solidbase/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer
		document={({ assets, children, scripts }) => (
			<html {...getHtmlProps()}>
				...
			</html>
		)}
	/>
));
```

:::note
SolidBase prerenders your pages by default, so `data-theme` will probably be incorrect in the initial HTML.
To account for this, this small script will automatically be injected to correct the theme before the page is rendered.
:::

## Done!

Your project is now setup with the default SolidBase theme!
You can now create Markdown routes in your project that take advantage of SolidBase's [Markdown Extensions](../markdown),
and customise your project's appearance by [customising the default theme](../extending-themes#extending-the-default-theme) or [creating a new theme](../custom-themes).
