# Markdown Extensions

SolidBase comes with many markdown extensions from [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) to fully custom ones.
All of their options and usage examples are listed here.

## Autolinked Titles

All titles will have an associated unique slug and self link.

```md
# My Docs

## Subheading
```

will generate:

```html
<h1 id="my-docs"><a href="#my-docs">My Docs</a></h1>

<h2 id="subheading"><a href="#subheading">Subheading</a></h2>
```

## External Links

Outbound links automatically get `target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"`:

- [start.solidjs.com](https://start.solidjs.com)
- [SolidBase on GitHub](https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase)

## Frontmatter

[YAML frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) is supported out of the box:

```yaml
---
title: SolidBase
layout: home
---
```

This data will be available to the rest of the page, along with all custom and theming components.

For more details, see [Frontmatter](../reference/frontmatter).

## GitHub Flavored Markown

### Alerts

SolidBase also supports [GitHub-flavored alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) to render as callouts. They will be rendered the same as the [custom containers](#custom-containers).

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase
```

**Output**

start.solidjs.com
https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase

### Strikethrough

Strikethrough text is any text wrapped in a matching pair of one or two tildes (`~`).

**Input**

```md
~~Hi~~ Hello, ~there~ world!
```

**Output**

~~Hi~~ Hello, ~there~ world!

### Tables

**Input**

```md
| a        | b        |        c |    d     |
| -------- | :------- | -------: | :------: |
| longword | longword | longword | longword |
| short    | short    |    short | `short`  |
```

**Output**

| a        | b        |        c |    d     |
| -------- | :------- | -------: | :------: |
| longword | longword | longword | longword |

### Task List

**Input**

```md
- [ ] to do
- [x] done
```

**Output**

## Kbd

While not a markdown syntax, a key input element can be written using html.

**Input**

```md
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>
```

**Output**

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

## Footnotes

Footnotes can be added anywhere in the document and a link will be generated pointing to it.
All notes are inserted at the end of the document with a corresponding backlink.

**Input**

```md
A note[^1]

[^1]: Big note.
```

**Output**

A note[^1]

[^1]: Big note.

## Syntax Highlighting in Code Blocks

SolidBase uses [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) to highlight language syntax in Markdown code blocks, using coloured text. Expressive Code supports a wide variety of programming languages and additional features. All you need to do is append a valid language alias to the beginning backticks for the code block:

**Input**

````
```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Counter/>
  );
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "values": 4
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return <Counter />;
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "values": 4
  }
}
```

A [list of valid languages](https://github.com/antfu/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/README.md) is available on GitHub.

## Line Highlighting in Code Blocks

**Input**

````
```ts {4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: "Highlighted!"
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```ts {4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: "Highlighted!"
    }
  }
}
```

In addition to a single line, you can also specify multiple single lines, ranges, or both:

- Line ranges: for example `{1-4}`, `{6-10}`, `{12-20}`
- Multiple single lines: for example `{4, 6, 10}`
- Line ranges and single lines: for example `{4, 6-10, 15, 20-24, 40}`

**Input**

````
```js {1, 4, 6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: "Highlighted!"
      other: "Not highlighted",
      f: `But
      we
      are`,
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js {1, 4, 6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: "Highlighted!"
      other: "Not highlighted",
      f: `But
      we
      are`,
    }
  }
}
```

## Line Numbers

You can enable line numbers for each code block by adding `showLineNumbers` after the language.

**Input**

````md
```ts
// line numbers are disabled by default
const line2 = "This is line 2";
const line3 = "This is line 3";
```

```ts showLineNumbers
// line numbers are enabled
const line2 = "This is line 2";
const line3 = "This is line 3";
```
````

**Output**

```ts
// line numbers are disabled by default
const line2 = "This is line 2";
const line3 = "This is line 3";
```

<br />

```ts showLineNumbers
// line numbers are enabled
const line2 = 'This is line 2'
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
```

## Collapsible

// TODO

## Code Tabs

**Input**

````md
```tsx {4} tab title="a.tsx"
import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp a />;
}
```

```tsx {4} tab title="b.tsx"
import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp b />;
}
```
````

**Output**

```tsx {4} tab title="a.tsx"
import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp a />;
}
```

```tsx {4} tab title="b.tsx"
import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp b />;
}
```
