## SolidBase Entry

The entry point for a SolidBase project is the `app.config.ts` file located in the root of your project.

```ts title=app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

import { createWithSolidBase } from "@kobalte/solidbase";


export default defineConfig(
	createWithSolidBase(theme)(
		/* SolidStart options */
		{
			ssr: true,
			server: {
				prerender: {
					crawlLinks: true,
				},
			},
			...
		},
		/* SolidBase options */
		{
			title: "SolidBase",
			description: "Fully featured, fully customisable static site generation for SolidStart",
			...
    }
  )
);

```

## Routing

Since SolidBase is built on top of SolidStart, it uses the same file based routing system. Using file-based routing is recommended for both management and performance reasons.

The `src/routes` directory is where you define your application's routes. Each file in this directory, corresponds to a route in your application. For example, `src/routes/index.mdx` corresponds to the root route `/`, and `src/routes/about.mdx` corresponds to the `/about` route.

```
├─ src
│  ├─ routes
│  │  ├─ index.mdx
│  │  └─ about.mdx
│  ├─ app.tsx
│  ├─ entry-client.tsx
│  └─ entry-server.tsx
└─ app.config.ts
```

Full documentation and reference can be found in the [SolidStart docs](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/building-your-application/routing).
