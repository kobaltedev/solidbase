# Custom Themes

Themes are comprised of a definition and a set of components.

## Defining a Theme

Use the `defineTheme` helper to define a theme.
At minimum you must provide `componentsPath`, an absolute path to the directory containing the theme's components,
and we'd recommend providing a config type.

```ts
import { defineTheme } from "@kobalte/solidbase/config";

type CustomThemeConfig = {};

const customTheme = defineTheme<CustomThemeConfig>({
  componentsPath: import.meta.resolve("./custom-theme"),
});
```

### Components Folder

The folder at `componentsPath` must contain a `Layout` file and optionally an `mdx-components` file.
All other files in this directory will be ignored,
feel free to organize your components however you'd like.

The `Layout` file is the runtime entrypoint for the theme and will be rendered by `SolidBaseRoot`.
It must have a component as its default export.

Any named exports from `mdx-components` will be given to `MDXProvider` from [solid-mdx](https://github.com/nksaraf/solid-mdx),
making them available in MDX files without needing to be imported.
Components with lowercase names will override HTML elements of the same name.

Some exports have special uses:

- `DirectiveContainer`: Rendered whenever a [Markdown directive](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive) is encountered.

### Vite Plugin

Themes can provide their own Vite plugin by defining a `vite` function.
This function receives the SolidBase config and should return a [Vite plugin](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin).

You can use it to conditionally import code based on the provided config,
load virtual modules generated by the theme, or anything else you'd want a Vite plugin for.

```ts
const customTheme = defineTheme<CustomThemeConfig>({
	...,
	vite(config: SolidBaseResolvedConfig<CustomThemeConfig>) {
		return {
			... // a regular Vite plugin
		}
	}
})
```

:::info
SolidBase's default theme uses its own Vite plugin to
[conditionally import fonts](https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase/blob/e5c4f2eccdb2b17aba71d7a3d960980f455ab62b/src/default-theme/index.ts#L24-L26)!

## Building a Layout

The most basic `Layout` receives the current route as `children` and renders it:

```tsx
import { ParentProps } from "solid-js";

export default function Layout(props: ParentProps) {
  return <>{props.children}</>;
}
```

You can use the SolidBase config and each page's metadata to customize the layout
via `useSolidBaseContext` and `useCurrentPageData` respectively.

## Distributing a Custom Theme

SolidBase themes are most easily distributed as npm packages.
If using TypeScript, your theme definition must be compiled to JavaScript before publishing.
It's up to you whether you distribute your theme's components as TS or JS.

## Consuming a Theme

To consume a theme, import its definition in your `app.config` and use it to create a custom `withSolidBase` function:

```ts
import { someTheme } from "awesome-solidbase-theme";

const withSolidBase = createWithSolidBase(someTheme);

export default defineConfig(withSolidBase(...))
```

You can add to the theme by [extending](./extending-themes) it with your own theme.
