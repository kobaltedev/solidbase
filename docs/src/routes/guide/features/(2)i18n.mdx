SolidBase has built-in i18n support which can be configured in the root config:

```ts
export default defineConfig(
	createWithSolidBase(theme)(
		/* SolidStart options */
		{
			...
		},
		/* SolidBase options */
		{
			...
			lang: "en", // default lang without route prefix
			locales: {
				fr: {
					label: "Français",
					themeConfig: {
						...
					},
				},
			},
			...
    }
  )
);
```

## Creating Localized Routes

To create localized routes, simply create a folder with the locale code inside the `src/routes` directory. All files within this folder will be served under the corresponding locale prefix. For example, files in `src/routes/fr` will be accessible under the `/fr` path. The default locale (e.g., `en`) will not have a prefix and will be served from the root path. The folder structure would look like this:

```
src
└─ routes
   ├─ fr
   │  ├─ index.mdx
   │  └─ about.mdx
   ├─ index.mdx
   └─ about.mdx
```

## Theme Configuration

Similar to the theme configuration for the default locale, you can provide a `themeConfig` for each locale to customize the theme for that specific language. To learn more about how to adjust the theme configuration, refer to the [Theme Configuration section within the config page](/guide/config#theme-configuration).
