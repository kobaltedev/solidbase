# {frontmatter.title}

SolidBase provides multiple ways to extend markdown syntax from [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) to fully customized ones. The following sections list all of their options and usage examples.

## Autolinked Titles

Each title, heading, and subheading will automatically be given a unique slug and self link.

```md tab title="Markdown"
# My Docs

## Subheading
```

```html tab title="HTML Output"
<h1 id="my-docs"><a href="#my-docs">My Docs</a></h1>

<h2 id="subheading"><a href="#subheading">Subheading</a></h2>
```

## External Links

Each outbound link will automatically get `target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"` attributes for security and performance reasons.

```md tab title="Markdown"
[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com)
[SolidBase on GitHub](https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase)
```

```html tab title="HTML Output"
<a href="https://www.solidjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SolidJS</a>
<a href="https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SolidBase on GitHub</a>
```

## Frontmatter

Out of the box, SolidBase supports [YAML frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) to define metadata at the top of your markdown files. To add frontmatter to your markdown file, simply add a YAML block at the very top of the file, wrapped in triple dashes `---`.

```mdx title="Markdown"
---
title: SolidBase
layout: home
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```

The data defined in the frontmatter will be parsed and made available to the page as a `frontmatter` object. It is made available through the entire application, including all custom and theming components.

For more details, see the [Frontmatter reference](../reference/frontmatter).

## Table of Contents

You can automatically generate a table of contents (ToC) for your markdown files by adding `[[toc]]` anywhere in the document. The ToC will be generated based on all titles, headings, and subheadings in the document.

**Input**

```
[[toc]]
```

**Output**

[[toc]]

## Directives

Directives are custom blocks that can be used to highlight important information, warnings, tips, and more. They are similar to callouts or alerts in other documentation systems.

**Input**

```md
:::info
Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
:::

:::tip
Optional information to help a user be more successful.
:::

:::important
Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
:::

:::warning
Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
:::

:::danger
Negative potential consequences of an action.
:::

:::details
This is a details block.
:::
```

**Output**

:::info
Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
:::

:::tip
Optional information to help a user be more successful.
:::

:::important
Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
:::

:::warning
Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
:::

:::danger
Negative potential consequences of an action.
:::

:::details
This is a details block.
:::

### Custom Directive Titles

To set a custom title for a directive, use square brackets `[]` immediately after the directive type.

**Input**

```md
:::info[Custom Title]
Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
:::

:::tip[]
This is a tip with no title.
:::

:::details[Click me to view]
This is a details block.
:::
```

**Output**

:::info[Custom Title]
Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
:::

:::tip[]
This is a tip with no title.
:::

:::details[Click me to view]
This is a details block.
:::

## GitHub Flavored Markown

In addition to the standard markdown syntax, SolidBase also supports several GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions.

### Alerts

In addition to the directives above, SolidBase also supports [GitHub-flavored alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). These alerts can render as callouts with similar styles to the [directives above](#directives).

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.

### Autolinks

SolidBase is able to automatically detect and convert URLs into clickable links. This works for URLs containing the protocol (e.g., `https://example.com`) as well as those without (e.g., `www.example.com` or `example.com`).

**Input**

```md
start.solidjs.com
https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase
```

**Output**

start.solidjs.com

https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase

### Tables

**Input**

```md
| a        | b        |        c |    d     |
| -------- | :------- | -------: | :------: |
| longword | longword | longword | longword |
| short    | short    |    short | `short`  |
```

**Output**

| a        | b        |        c |    d     |
| -------- | :------- | -------: | :------: |
| longword | longword | longword | longword |
| short    | short    |    short | `short`  |

### Task Lists

**Input**

```md
- [ ] to do
- [x] done
```

**Output**

- [ ] to do
- [x] done

### Horizontal Rules

You can create horizontal rules (or horizontal lines) through the following methods:

- Three or more hyphens (`---`)
- Three or more asterisks (`***`)
- Three or more underscores (`___`)
- HTML `<hr />` tag


## Footnotes

Footnotes are able to be added anywhere in the document using `[^label]` syntax, where `label` is a unique identifier for the footnote. To define the footnote content, the footnote definition should be placed at the end of the document, using the same `[^label]:` syntax followed by the footnote text.

**Input**

```md
A note[^1]

[^1]: Big note.
```

**Output**

A note[^1]

[^1]: Big note.

## Code Blocks

SolidBase uses [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) to highlight code blocks. Expressive Code is a fast and flexible syntax highlighter that supports a wide range of programming languages as well as additional features like line highlighting, line numbers, collapsible sections, code tabs, and more. The list of supported languages is [available on GitHub]](https://github.com/antfu/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/README.md)

To use Expressive Code, simply wrap your code in triple backticks (```) and specify the language after the opening backticks. This will enable syntax highlighting for that language.

**Input**

````
```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Counter/>
  );
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "values": 4
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return <Counter />;
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "values": 4
  }
}
```

### Line Highlighting

In addition to syntax highlighting, you can also highlight specific lines in a code block by adding curly braces `{}` after the language and specifying the line numbers or ranges you want to highlight. You can specify single lines (e.g., `{4}`), multiple single lines (e.g., `{4, 6, 10}`), line ranges (e.g., `{1-4}`), or a combination of both (e.g., `{4, 6-10, 15, 20-24, 40}`).

**Input**

````
```js {1, 4, 6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: "Highlighted!"
      other: "Not highlighted",
      f: `But
      we
      are`,
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js {1, 4, 6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: "Highlighted!"
      other: "Not highlighted",
      f: `But
      we
      are`,
    }
  }
}
```

### Line Numbers

By default, line numbers are disabled. To enable them, add `showLineNumbers` after the language.

**Input**

````md
```ts showLineNumbers
const line2 = "This is line 2";
const line3 = "This is line 3";
```
````

**Output**

```ts showLineNumbers
const line2 = 'This is line 2'
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
```

### Code Tabs

When you have multiple related code blocks, you can group them into tabs for better organization and readability. To create code tabs, add `tab` after the language and specify a `title` for each tab.

**Input**

````md
```tsx {4} tab title="a.tsx"

import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp a />;
}

```

```tsx {4} tab title="b.tsx"

import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp b />;
}

```
````

**Output**

```tsx {4} tab title="a.tsx"
import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp a />;
}
```

```tsx {4} tab title="b.tsx"
import { SolidBaseApp } from "@kobalte/solidbase";

export default function App() {
  return <SolidBaseApp b />;
}
```
