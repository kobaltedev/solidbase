## Key features

### Built-in Markdown

Out of the box support for Markdown and MDX with almost all extensions you'd ever want. All the extension documentation and examples are available on our [Markdown Extensions](/md-extentions) page.

### Customizable

All SolidBase components are overridable and can transform your website into any look or structure. Checkout our [Customization and Theming](/customization) documentation.

### Performant

Instant first load by prerendering each page during build, next navigation will be upgraded to client side and smoothly transition pages.
